## TODO

- [x] Expose public API only through index.js to avoid tight coupling and circular dependencies
- [ ] Clean up routing terminology "parameter" vs "var"
- [ ] Fix hot reloading for routes and make hot reloading something that usually works for 
      every service that depends on loading a config file
